# Charging-Curve-Prediction
This repository contains data and code for developing deep neural networks to estimate entire charging curves. 

Please check readme.txt in each folder for more details.

Some public battery degradation datasets are used, including the Oxford battery degradation dataset 1 [https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:03ba4b01-cfed-46d3-9b1a-7d4a7bdf6fac], CALCE dataset [https://calce.umd.edu/data#INR], and the NASA Randomized Battery Usage Data Set [https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#batteryrnddischarge].
