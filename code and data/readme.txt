The oxford folder contains the pre-processed data from the Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset 1 [the orignal data can be found at https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:03ba4b01-cfed-46d3-9b1a-7d4a7bdf6fac] and the corresponding python file to develop a deep neural network (DNN) that can predict the entire charging curves with 300 mV pieces of charging curve.

The transfer-nasa folder contains the pre-precessed data from the NASA Randomized Battery Usage Data Set [the orignal data can be found at https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#batteryrnddischarge] and the corresponding python file to apply transfer learning to develop the DNN for curve prediction.
